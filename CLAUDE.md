## ‚ö° Performance & Execution (MANDATORY)

### Parallel Execution - ALWAYS ENABLED
**CRITICAL**: You MUST execute independent operations in parallel by using multiple tool calls in a single message.

#### When to Use Parallel Execution (Always apply these rules):

1. **Multiple File Reads**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: Single message with 3 Read tool calls
   ‚ùå WRONG: 3 separate messages with 1 Read each
   ```

2. **Multiple Searches**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: Multiple Grep/Glob calls simultaneously
   ‚ùå WRONG: Sequential search operations
   ```

3. **Independent Git Operations**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: Run git status, git diff, git log in parallel
   ‚ùå WRONG: One git command at a time
   ```

4. **Testing & Quality Checks**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: lint + type-check + test in parallel
   ‚ùå WRONG: Run lint, wait, then type-check, wait, then test
   ```

5. **Code Analysis**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: Read multiple related files at once
   ‚ùå WRONG: Read one file, analyze, then read next
   ```

#### When NOT to Use Parallel Execution:

- Operations that depend on each other (A needs result from B)
- Sequential workflows (git add ‚Üí git commit ‚Üí git push)
- One result determines the next action

#### Example of Correct Parallel Usage:
```
User: "Check the authentication flow"

CORRECT:
- Single message with parallel Read calls:
  - Read: app/api/auth/login.ts
  - Read: app/api/auth/register.ts
  - Read: lib/auth.ts
  - Read: middleware.ts

WRONG:
- Message 1: Read login.ts
- Wait for response
- Message 2: Read register.ts
- Wait for response...
```

**Failure to use parallel execution is a performance bug that must be avoided.**

## ü§ñ Autonomous Agent & Command Usage (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Claude MUST automatically and proactively use all available agents, slash commands, and tools from the `.claude/` directory based on the task context. No explicit user request is required.

### üî• Core Automation Principles

**ALWAYS:**
1. ‚úÖ Use Task tool to invoke agents for complex, multi-step operations
2. ‚úÖ Execute slash commands via SlashCommand tool when context matches
3. ‚úÖ Run multiple operations in parallel when independent
4. ‚úÖ Reference `.claude/prompts/` for best practices guidelines
5. ‚úÖ Follow `.claude/workflows/` for structured task execution

**NEVER:**
1. ‚ùå Wait for explicit user request to use agents/commands
2. ‚ùå Process tasks sequentially when parallel execution is possible
3. ‚ùå Ignore available agents that match task context
4. ‚ùå Skip quality checks (tests, security, linting) before completion

### Automatic Agent Engagement

Claude should **automatically invoke specialized agents** when the task context matches their expertise:

**Available Agents** (from `.claude/agents/`):
- **architect.md** - Auto-engage for: system design, architecture decisions, tech stack selection, scalability planning
- **fullstack-developer.md** - Auto-engage for: feature development, API implementation, database operations, full-stack tasks
- **devops-sre.md** - Auto-engage for: deployment, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, infrastructure, monitoring
- **data-engineer.md** - Auto-engage for: ETL pipelines, data warehousing, analytics, data modeling
- **security-expert.md** - Auto-engage for: security audits, authentication, authorization, vulnerability scanning, encryption

**Rules for Agent Usage**:
1. **Automatically detect** which agent(s) are needed based on task keywords and context
2. **Invoke agents proactively** without waiting for explicit user request
3. **Use multiple agents** in parallel when task requires multiple specializations
4. **Switch agents** dynamically as the task evolves (e.g., architect ‚Üí fullstack-developer ‚Üí devops-sre for feature ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí deployment)

**Example**:
```
User: "Add a user authentication system"
Claude:
- Automatically engages security-expert.md for auth design
- Then engages fullstack-developer.md for implementation
- Finally engages devops-sre.md for deployment considerations
```

### Automatic Slash Command Usage

Claude should **automatically execute slash commands** from `.claude/commands/` when relevant to the task:

**Available Commands** (Use freely and automatically):
- `/analyze` - Auto-run when: user asks about code structure, needs architecture overview, starting new project exploration
- `/test` - Auto-run when: implementing features, fixing bugs, before deployment, after refactoring
- `/debug` - Auto-run when: errors occur, unexpected behavior reported, investigating issues
- `/refactor` - Auto-run when: code quality issues detected, complexity warnings, improving maintainability
- `/optimize` - Auto-run when: performance issues mentioned, slow response times, resource optimization needed
- `/security` - Auto-run when: handling auth, dealing with user data, before deployment, security concerns mentioned
- `/deploy` - Auto-run when: user wants to ship code, deployment mentioned, CI/CD setup needed
- `/docs` - Auto-run when: documentation outdated, new features added, complex logic implemented
- `/migrate` - Auto-run when: tech stack changes, framework upgrades, database migrations needed

**Rules for Command Usage**:
1. **Execute commands proactively** based on task context - don't wait for explicit `/command` syntax
2. **Chain commands intelligently** (e.g., `/test` ‚Üí `/security` ‚Üí `/deploy` for production readiness)
3. **Run commands in parallel** when independent (e.g., `/test` and `/lint` simultaneously)
4. **Inform user** which command you're running and why (briefly)

**Example**:
```
User: "I just implemented a new API endpoint"
Claude: "I'll run /test to verify it works, /security to check for vulnerabilities, and /docs to update the API documentation"
[Executes these commands automatically]
```

### Automatic Workflow Application

Claude should **automatically follow workflows** from `.claude/workflows/` for structured tasks:

**Available Workflows**:
- **feature-development.md** - Auto-apply for: new features, significant changes
- **debugging.md** - Auto-apply for: bug reports, errors, unexpected behavior
- **code-review.md** - Auto-apply for: code review requests, before deployment, quality checks

**Example**:
```
User: "Build a comment system"
Claude: [Automatically follows feature-development.md workflow]
1. Understand requirements (asks clarifying questions)
2. Design architecture (engages architect agent)
3. Implement code (engages fullstack-developer agent)
4. Write tests (runs /test command)
5. Review and optimize (runs /refactor, /optimize, /security)
```

### Automatic Tool & Prompt Usage

Claude should **leverage all resources** from `.claude/` directory intelligently:

**Prompts** (`.claude/prompts/` - Use as internal guidelines):
- **code-quality.md** - Auto-apply when: writing code, reviewing code, refactoring
- **debugging-guide.md** - Auto-apply when: debugging, investigating errors
- **project-setup.md** - Auto-apply when: initializing new features, setting up infrastructure
- **optimization-strategies.md** - Auto-apply when: performance tuning, resource optimization

**Settings** (`.claude/settings.json` - Always active):
- **Permissions**: All tools allowed except sensitive file access (.env, *.pem, *.key)
- **Environment**: Parallel execution, auto-agents, auto-commands all ENABLED
- **Security**: Automatic denial of secret/credential file access

### Decision Matrix for Autonomous Actions

| Task Type | Auto-Engage Agent(s) | Auto-Run Commands | Auto-Apply Workflow |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| New Feature | fullstack-developer | /analyze, /test, /security | feature-development.md |
| Bug Fix | fullstack-developer | /debug, /test | debugging.md |
| Performance Issue | fullstack-developer | /analyze, /optimize | N/A |
| Deployment | devops-sre | /test, /security, /deploy | N/A |
| Architecture Design | architect | /analyze | N/A |
| Security Audit | security-expert | /security, /analyze | N/A |
| Code Review | N/A | /refactor, /test, /security | code-review.md |
| Documentation | fullstack-developer | /docs | N/A |
| Tech Migration | architect, data-engineer | /analyze, /migrate, /test | N/A |

### Important Rules

1. **Be Proactive, Not Reactive**: Don't wait for users to explicitly mention agents/commands - detect needs automatically
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Use multiple agents in parallel when task requires diverse expertise
3. **Command Chaining**: Link commands logically (test ‚Üí security ‚Üí deploy)
4. **Context Awareness**: Adapt agent/command selection based on project type (frontend vs backend vs full-stack)
5. **Transparency**: Briefly inform user which agents/commands you're using and why
6. **Flexibility**: Override automatic selections if user explicitly requests different approach
