# Code Review Workflow

A comprehensive guide for conducting effective code reviews.

## Phase 1: Preparation

### Before Reviewing

#### Context Gathering
- [ ] Read the PR/MR description
- [ ] Understand the feature or bug being addressed
- [ ] Review linked issues or tickets
- [ ] Check acceptance criteria
- [ ] Note any special requirements

#### Set Up Review Environment
- [ ] Checkout the branch locally
- [ ] Install dependencies if changed
- [ ] Run the application
- [ ] Test the feature manually
- [ ] Run tests locally

```bash
# Checkout PR branch
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Install and test
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
```

## Phase 2: Code Review Checklist

### 1. Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è

- [ ] **Does it work?** Test the feature thoroughly
- [ ] **Meets requirements?** Matches acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Edge cases handled?** Tests unusual inputs
- [ ] **Error handling?** Graceful failure scenarios
- [ ] **No regressions?** Existing features still work

### 2. Code Quality üìù

#### Readability
- [ ] **Clear naming?** Variables and functions are descriptive
- [ ] **Proper formatting?** Consistent with project style
- [ ] **Comments helpful?** Explains "why", not "what"
- [ ] **No dead code?** Unused imports, functions removed
- [ ] **DRY principle?** No unnecessary duplication

#### Structure
- [ ] **Single responsibility?** Functions/components do one thing
- [ ] **Appropriate abstraction?** Not over or under-engineered
- [ ] **Proper separation of concerns?** Logic, UI, data separated
- [ ] **Follows project patterns?** Consistent with codebase

#### TypeScript/Types
- [ ] **Proper typing?** No unnecessary `any` types
- [ ] **Interfaces defined?** Clear type contracts
- [ ] **Type inference used?** Where appropriate
- [ ] **No type errors?** `npm run type-check` passes

### 3. Testing üß™

- [ ] **Tests included?** New code has tests
- [ ] **Tests pass?** All tests green
- [ ] **Good coverage?** Critical paths tested
- [ ] **Meaningful assertions?** Tests verify behavior
- [ ] **Edge cases tested?** Not just happy path

```typescript
// Good test example
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should handle empty user list', async () => {
    const result = await userService.getUsers();
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('should throw error for invalid user ID', async () => {
    await expect(userService.getUser('invalid')).rejects.toThrow();
  });
});
```

### 4. Performance üöÄ

- [ ] **No obvious bottlenecks?** Efficient algorithms
- [ ] **Database queries optimized?** Proper indexing, no N+1
- [ ] **Appropriate caching?** Where beneficial
- [ ] **No memory leaks?** Proper cleanup
- [ ] **Bundle size impact?** Check if significant

### 5. Security üîí

- [ ] **Input validation?** All user inputs validated
- [ ] **SQL injection safe?** Using parameterized queries
- [ ] **XSS prevention?** Proper escaping
- [ ] **Secrets secure?** No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] **Authentication/authorization?** Proper access control
- [ ] **Dependencies safe?** No known vulnerabilities

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: SQL injection risk
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// ‚úÖ Good: Parameterized query
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
```

### 6. Accessibility ‚ôø

- [ ] **Semantic HTML?** Proper element usage
- [ ] **ARIA labels?** Where needed
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation?** Tab order works
- [ ] **Color contrast?** WCAG AA compliant
- [ ] **Screen reader friendly?** Alt text, labels

### 7. Error Handling üö®

- [ ] **Errors caught?** Try/catch where needed
- [ ] **Helpful messages?** User-friendly errors
- [ ] **Logging?** Errors logged appropriately
- [ ] **Error boundaries?** React error boundaries if needed
- [ ] **Graceful degradation?** Falls back sensibly

### 8. Documentation üìö

- [ ] **README updated?** If setup changed
- [ ] **API documented?** New endpoints described
- [ ] **Comments added?** For complex logic
- [ ] **Types documented?** JSDoc where helpful
- [ ] **Breaking changes noted?** If any

## Phase 3: Provide Feedback

### Feedback Principles

#### Be Constructive
```markdown
‚ùå "This code is bad"
‚úÖ "Consider extracting this into a separate function for better readability"

‚ùå "You don't know what you're doing"
‚úÖ "This approach might cause performance issues. Have you considered using memoization?"
```

#### Be Specific
```markdown
‚ùå "Fix the styling"
‚úÖ "The button should use the primary color from the theme (line 42)"

‚ùå "This won't work"
‚úÖ "This will fail when the API returns null. Add a null check before accessing properties."
```

#### Distinguish Severity

**Critical (Must Fix) üî¥**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes
- Data loss risks
- Major bugs

**Important (Should Fix) üü°**
- Performance issues
- Missing tests
- Poor error handling
- Accessibility problems

**Nice to Have (Optional) üü¢**
- Code style preferences
- Minor optimizations
- Refactoring suggestions
- Additional comments

**Example Comments:**
```markdown
üî¥ CRITICAL: This endpoint doesn't validate user permissions, allowing unauthorized access.

üü° IMPORTANT: Missing error handling here could crash the application if the API fails.

üü¢ NIT: Consider renaming `data` to `userData` for clarity.
```

### Comment Template

```markdown
## Summary
Brief overview of the changes

## Strengths
- Well-written tests
- Clean component structure
- Good error handling

## Issues Found

### Critical
- [ ] Security: User input not sanitized (line 42)

### Important
- [ ] Missing null check in API call (line 67)
- [ ] No loading state for async operation (line 89)

### Suggestions
- Consider using useMemo for expensive calculation (line 105)
- Extract this logic into a custom hook for reusability

## Questions
- Why was approach X chosen over Y?
- Is there a specific reason for this pattern?

## Verdict
- ‚úÖ Approve
- üîÑ Request Changes
- üí¨ Comment Only
```

## Phase 4: Collaboration

### Responding to Reviews

**As Author:**
- Thank reviewers for feedback
- Ask for clarification if needed
- Explain decisions when helpful
- Make requested changes promptly
- Re-request review after changes

**As Reviewer:**
- Respond to questions
- Approve after fixes
- Be available for discussion
- Follow up on critical issues

### Conflict Resolution

If you disagree:
1. Understand the reviewer's perspective
2. Explain your reasoning
3. Discuss trade-offs
4. Escalate if needed (team lead, architect)
5. Document the decision

## Review Workflows

### Small PR (< 200 lines)
- 10-15 minute review
- Focus on logic and tests
- Quick approval if good

### Medium PR (200-500 lines)
- 30-45 minute review
- Full checklist
- May need multiple rounds

### Large PR (> 500 lines)
- Request smaller PRs
- Or review in phases
- Consider pair programming

## Automated Checks

Leverage CI/CD to check automatically:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: PR Checks

on: pull_request

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      # Parallel checks
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Type Check
        run: npm run type-check

      - name: Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Security Audit
        run: npm audit
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### React/Next.js
- Missing keys in lists
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Improper hook dependencies
- Server/client component confusion
- Hydration mismatches

### TypeScript
- Liberal use of `any`
- Type assertions (`as`) hiding errors
- Missing null checks
- Incorrect type definitions

### General
- Hardcoded values (use constants)
- Copy-paste duplication
- Overly complex functions
- Missing error handling
- Poor variable naming
