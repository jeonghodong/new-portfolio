Help with technology migration:

Ask the user:
- What technology/framework to migrate FROM
- What technology/framework to migrate TO
- Scope of migration (full or partial)

Then:
1. Analyze current implementation
2. Plan migration strategy
3. Implement step-by-step migration
4. Test migrated code
5. Document changes and breaking points
